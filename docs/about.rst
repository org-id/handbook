About
=====

Information about organizations is more valuable when it includes:

* An unambiguous **organization identifier**

* A **clear name** for the organization

* Other **identifying information**

`org-id.guide <https://org-id.guide>`_ provides a register organization identifier lists that delivers the easiest, quickest and most accurate way for open data publishers to locate organisation identifiers.

Why use org-id.guide
--------------------

Quality
~~~~~~~

org-id.guide assigns a code that can be used to refer to each list. It ranks the quality of the lists based on the **stablility and accuracy** and the **availability of open data**. 

The higher the quality, the more likely it is that the identifiers can be used to link up information across datasets. 

Relevance
~~~~~~~~~

The org-id.guide web application provides a search tool to locate relevant identifier lists. Search results are ranked by **relevance**. 

The more **relevant** a list, the more likely that it will contain the organization that a user is looking for. 

Connected
~~~~~~~~~

Each entry in org-id.guide has detailed meta-data and information that can be used to locate the identifiers that the list contains, whether through online search or open datasets. 

We use this meta-data to recommend use of lists that have the best chance of making org-id connections between different datasets.

Collaborative
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

org-id.guide is a living list - improved by a coalition of open data standards projects. You can help improve the coverage and depth of the org-id.guide register. Changes go through a simple governance process. 


What org-id.guide is not
------------------------

org-id.guide **does not** directly maintain organisation identifiers itself. Instead, it signposts to existing sources of identification: helping data publishers and users choose the best identifier schemes to use for their purpose.
