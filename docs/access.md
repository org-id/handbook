Using the register
===========================

The canonical source for the org-id.guide register exists on the master branch of https://github.com/org-id/register

All codes with ```confirmed: true``` are part of the register.

The application at http://org-id.guide provides a front-end for exploring the register, as well as XML, JSON and CSV downloads of the full register of organisation identifier lists.
